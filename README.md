# Social Data DIY

This repository could potentially be the beginning of DIY toolkit to analyse tweets, and, with time, maybe other types of social data.

Currently it only does this:
1. Fetch tweets from list of Tweet IDs

Thanks to [Jason Lustbader](https://github.com/jasonlustbader) and Tomaz Logar for the first iteration of getTweetsByID.py.
